## OnFinality High Performance Public Infrastructure (Aug - October 2022)

**Abstract** - Ongoing costs for the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable public infrastructure for the Moonbeam and Moonbase Alpha networks from 1st August 2022 until 31st October 2022 (2 months).

**Motivation** - Setting up blockchain infrastructure is difficult, time consuming, and expensive. A shared node API service helps mitigate these barriers of entry to trying accessing a new protocol by reducing all these costs to near zero. In summary, we try to reduce the pain of getting started on the Moonbeam Networks and minimise the costs of accessing secure nodes while traffic from your dApp is low.

**Project Overview and Team Experience** - [OnFinality](https://onfinality.io/) is a SaaS platform providing infrastructure services for the Polkadot/Substrate community. Our mission is to support all blockchain developers in the world by providing core infrastructure so they can focus on building the next dApp.

**Overall Cost** - This proposal includes combined running costs for our infrastructure for all Moonbeam Networks. The total outstanding costs for these networks are 66,144.85 GLMR

**Use of Treasury Funds** - All funds will be used to pay for resources and infrastructure used to provide the service during August to October 2022

**Specifications** - We have a heavily modified multi-cloud and multi-region landscape that maximizes performance, reliability, scalability, and decentralisation. Additionally, we are proud to have delivered some key service enhancements that benefit the ecosystem in the last quarter. This includes:

* [API Insights](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-introduces-api-insights-so-you-can-analyse-and-learn-about-your-applications-faster/) so you can analyse and learn about your API applications faster and find bugs with your dApp
* [Cost optimisations](https://blog.onfinality.io/go-further-with-more-affordable-pricing/) to reduce pricing for our customers by up to 40%
* [New API plans](https://blog.onfinality.io/get-ahead-with-onfinalitys-new-api-endpoints/) for our high usage customers and a way to allocate resource to [move towards a more sustainable funding model](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1270)
* [Support for Alibaba Cloud](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-collaborates-with-alibaba-cloud-to-provide-a-premium-experience-to-web3-builders/) to provide more decentralised cloud hosting options for our customers
* A variety of improvements to our health metric collection tools and automated recovery scripts to ensure our 99.9% SLA is exceeded.

**Steps to Implement** - This service has already been provided and we are proud to have achived 99.99% uptime for Moonbeam and Moonriver https://status.onfinality.io/.

**Weâ€™ve already made a on-chain proposal for 83,154.1985 GLMR. As this is greater than the updated GLMR proposal (66,144.85 GLMR) we will immediately refund the difference (17,009.3485 GLMR) to the Moonbeam treasury account on receipt of funds**
